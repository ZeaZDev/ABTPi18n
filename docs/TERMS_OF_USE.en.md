**Last Updated:**  November 10, 2025

Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms", "Terms of Use") carefully before using the Auto Bot Trader i18n platform (the "Service") operated by ("us", "we", or "our").

Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service.

By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, you may not access the Service.

## 1. The Service

Auto Bot Trader i18n (ABTPi18n) provides a software platform that allows users to connect to their cryptocurrency exchange accounts via API Keys and run automated trading strategies ("Bots").

We are a technology provider. We do **not** provide financial advice, investment advice, or trading brokerage services.

## 2. User Responsibilities

You are solely responsible for:
* **Your API Keys:** Securing your exchange accounts and API Keys. You must set appropriate permissions (e.g., enable trading, disable withdrawals) and use security features like IP Whitelisting as recommended by us.
* **Your Strategies:** The selection, configuration, and monitoring of your trading strategies. You acknowledge that you are using these Bots at your own discretion.
* **Your Taxes:** Calculating and paying any taxes that may arise from your trading activities.
* **Legal Compliance:** Ensuring your use of the Service is compliant with all laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.

## 3. Fees and Subscriptions

We reserve the right to require payment or subscription fees for use of the Services. We will provide you with ample notice of any such fees and you will have the opportunity to terminate your account before such changes take effect.

## 4. Prohibited Uses

You agree not to use the Service for any unlawful purpose or to:
* Engage in any market manipulation (e.g., pump and dump schemes).
* Attempt to bypass or compromise our security features, including our encryption.
* Use the service in a manner that could overload, damage, or impair the Service or interfere with any other party's use (e.g., exceeding Rate Limits excessively).

## 5. Critical Risk Disclosure

Trading cryptocurrencies, especially with leverage (Futures) or automation, is extremely risky and complex. By using the Service, you acknowledge and accept the following risks:

* **Risk of Financial Loss:** You may lose some or all of your capital. You should not trade with money you cannot afford to lose.
* **No Guarantee of Profit:** Past performance of a strategy is not indicative of future results. There is no guarantee that any Bot will perform as expected or be profitable.
* **Market Risk:** The value of cryptocurrencies is highly volatile. Flash crashes, market manipulation, and sudden regulatory changes can occur.
* **Liquidation Risk:** If trading Futures, a small market movement against your position can result in the total loss of your margin (Liquidation).
* **Technical Risk:** The Service relies on third-party APIs (e.g., Binance), networks, and software. Failures in these systems (API downtime, Rate Limit bans, bugs in the Bot) could result in financial loss, and we are not liable for them.
* **Not Financial Advice:** All information, strategies, and tools provided by ABTPi18n are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial or investment advice.
